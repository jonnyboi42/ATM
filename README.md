# ATM App (Practice Project)

This application was built as a personal learning project to gain hands-on experience with:

- **NextAuth (with JWT)** for authentication
- **NextAuth API Routes**
- **Prisma** and **PostgreSQL** for database interactions
- **Next.js** for the fullstack React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

It simulates a real-world application with:

- User account **sign-up and login** functionality
- An **admin account** with the ability to search for users
- Proper authentication flow using **JWT**
- A modular and scalable architecture

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repo is not intended for public cloning or collaboration. It was created for **my own practice and educational purposes**.
